## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
-   Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
-   Adjust the color theme based on their preference
-   Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)
